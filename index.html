                First things first
                I'ma say all the words inside my head
                I'm fired up and tired of
                The way that things have been, oh-ooh
                The way that things have been, oh-ooh
                <br><br></p>

                    Second things second
                    Don't you tell me what you think that I could be
                    I'm the one at the sail
                    I'm the master of my sea, oh-ooh
                    The master of my sea, oh-ooh

                    I was broken from a young age
                    Taking my sulkin' to the masses
                    Writing my poems for the few
                    That look at me, took to me, shook at me, feelin' me
                    Singing from heartache from the pain
                    Taking my message from the veins
                    Speaking my lesson from the brain
                    Seeing the beauty through the...

                    Building my rain up in the cloud
                    Falling like ashes to the ground
                    Hoping my feelings, they would drown
                    But they never did, ever lived, ebbin' and flowin'
                    Inhibited, limited 'til it broke open and rained down
                    It rained down, like…
